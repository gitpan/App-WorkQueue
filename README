1. What is the App-WorkQueue distribution?

It implements a new service in the App-Context framework called a
WorkQueue.  A normal queue supports push() and pop() operations
where the entries push()ed onto the queue come out in a first-in-
first-out (FIFO) basis.  A WorkQueue however is used to control the
processing of units of work, where the order that entries are
processed is prioritized subject to various constraints.

Therefore, a WorkQueue supports the following operations.

  push()      - add a unit of work to the queue
  acquire()   - get the highest priority entry subject to constraints
  release()   - remove an (acquired) entry from the queue
  unacquire() - return an (acquired) entry to the unacquired state

2. How do I install it?
